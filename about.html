        <p class="p1">As a young girl, I enjoyed playing dress up with my sisters and designing clothes for my Barbie dolls. I was creative and loved making things look pretty. In my teenage years, fashion became my passion. Putting colors and textures together is something I enjoyed doing. In high school, I gravitated toward the creative classes. My love of fashion, creativity, and the ability to expound on those things through meaningful user experiences has brought me to this new career in UX design.</p>

        <p class="p2">In the past, working in Human Resources as Senior Pension Administrator, and working closely with employees transitioning into retirement, it allowed me to gain skills that are easily transferable into the UX design field. The ability to empathize with my retirees, and understand their concerns regarding retirement, are skills I can draw on when problem-solving and coming up with user researched design solutions.  I dabbled with HTML in the past, and have always wanted to learn more about web design.</p>

        <p class="p3">My past experiences throughout my life and working career have placed me on this current path. Deciding to do a complete career change, was a big decision. Following my desire to get into UX design, is something that I feel I’m ready for at this time in my life. I see myself contributing to the UX design world, expressing my creativity through innovative design solutions.</p>

        <p class="p4">I love spending time with my family, traveling, knitting, eating great sushi, watching good movies and laughing out loud&hellip; a lot!!!</p>
